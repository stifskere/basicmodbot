## Basic customizable moderation bot
**The bot isn't done, there are some commands that aren't available and the bot may be buggy, the instructions aren't done for the current bot and those may change, only use the bot if you know what you're doing.**

> How to use the bot?
>
> 1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
>
> 2. Create an aplication
> 
> 3. Go to left panel and press ðŸ¤– "BOT"
>
> 4. Create a bot in the application
>
> 5. Open Configuration.HTML in your bot files
>
> 6. Go to your ðŸ¤–"BOT" tab in discord.dev and copy the token on your bot
> 
> 7. Then paste it on the "Token" input box in your html document.

Your bot first configuration is done now, but how do you invite the bot?

> 1. Go to left panel and press "Oauth2 => URL generator"
> 
> 2. On the scopes panel press BOT and then in the BOT PERMISSIONS panel press ADMINISTRATOR permission
> 
> 3. Bottom the page press COPY and paste your clipboard into a new tab in your browser.

Now you invited the bot. to configure it, change parameters in the html document

It is really easy to configure, just go through each tab in the HTML document and find the desired option
