        <p>Thanks for using Stifskere/basicmoderationbot as your custom server bot<br>
            As the name says this bot is kinda basic, but it can serve its function<br>
            when you propperly configured your bot for which you have instructions in
            <a href="README.md">here</a><br>
            you can use the command help in any channel to see all its commands <br>
            <br>
            This bot also can be customised a little changing the embed colors in<br>
            the customisation tab, any disclaimer or report send me a dm on discord for<br>
            which you have the tag in the footer of the page or if you want to commit on<br>
